You can put a .env in the working directory to load the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Configurables
Set the `API_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`, `SNAKEMQ_PORT` variables to override the defaults.

Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to change the OpenAI API endpoint that's being used (note this environment variable includes the protocol `https://...`).

### Docker
